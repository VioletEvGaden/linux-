<i>groff</i>(GNU troff) is a typesetting system that reads plain text
mixed with formatting commands and produces formatted output.
Output may be PostScript or PDF, HTML, or text for display at
terminal. Present on most Unix/Linux systems owing to its
long association with Unix manuals, 
<i>groff</i>is capable of producing
typographically sophisticated documents while consuming only
minimal system resources.

<h1>History</h1>
<p>
The first version of UNIX was developed on a PDP-7 which was sitting
around Bell Labs.  In 1971 the developers wanted to get a PDP-11 for
further work on the operating system.  In order to justify the cost for
this system, they proposed that they would implement a document
formatting system for the AT&T patents division.  This first formatting
program was a reimplementation of McIllroy's `roff', written by
J. F. Ossanna.
</p>
<p>
James Clark began work on a GNU implementation of `ditroff' in
early 1989. It was declared a stable (i.e. non-beta) package with the release of
version 1.04 around November 1991.

<h1>Why using groff?</h1>
<p>
Although WYSIWYG\(dg systems may be easier to use, they have a number of
disadvantages compared to `troff':
<foot>
\(dg WYSIWYG: What you see is what you get.
</foot>
</p>
<li> *
They must be used on a graphics display to work on a document.
</li>
<li> *
Most of the WYSIWYG systems are either non-free or are not very 
portable.
</li>
<li> *
`troff' is firmly entrenched in all UNIX systems.
</li>
<li> *
It is difficult to have a wide range of capabilities available 
within the confines of a GUI/window system.
</li>
<li> *
It is more difficult to make global changes to a document.

<h1>Table</h1>
<p>
This is an example of how to create table using tbl.
</p>
<table>
center, box, tab(@);
c s
c l.
\fBTable a01: \fPSome well-known TCP Ports

23@telnet
25@simple mail transfer protocal(SMTP)
80@hyper text transfer protocal(HTTP)
110@post office protocol(POP)
</table>
<h1>Equation</h1>
<p>
This is an example of how to write math equation using eqn.
</p>
<equation> (1.a01)
f( zeta ) -=- 1 over {2 pi i} int from C
f(z) over {z - zeta} dz
</equation>
<h1>Picture</h1>
<p>
This is an example of how to draw picture using pic.
</p>
<picture>
.ps -1
box invis "document"; arrow
box dashed "pic"; arrow
box dashed "tbl"; arrow
box dashed "eqn"; arrow
box "groff"; arrow
box invis "typesetter"
[ box invis "macro" "package"
spline right then up -> ] with .ne at 2nd last box.s
.ps +1

<h1>Convert it to pdf</h1>
<p>
Suppose your file has been saved as a01.ms, then you can convert it to a01.pdf using command as follows:
</p>
<pre> C
.I
groff -t -e -p -ms a01.ms | ps2pdf - a01.pdf 
.R
</pre>
<p>
Look, it is so simply, enjoy your work!
